Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to you to apply for the position of Analyst in the
Investments department of Blackrock. 

I am confident that my academic background, my experiences and my qualities are
ideal for a job in the in Investments at Blackrock.  Through my intership at
Starcom MediaVest Group, I acquired strong leadership and communications
skills. While working there, I took the initiative to combine the group's work
in a PowerPoint presentation that I presented to the client, and successfully
managed to convince him to stay with Starcom for another year. My
communications skills were later reinforced during my master's in strategic
marketing at Imperial College London, which was heavily based on group projects.

Yours faithfully,

Krystle Acquah
