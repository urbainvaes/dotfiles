Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to you to apply for the position of Analyst in the
Investments department of Blackrock. When I first heard from Blackrock
as a leading investement company. 

I am confident that my academic background, my experiences and my qualities are
ideal for a job in the in Investments at Blackrock.  Through my intership at
Starcom MediaVest Group, I acquired strong leadership and communications
skills. While working there, I took the initiative to combine the group's work
in a PowerPoint presentation and present it to the client, and successfully
managed to convince him to stay with Starcom for another year. My
communications skilled were later reinforced during my master's in strategic
marketing at Imperial College London, which was heavily based on group projects.

Yours faithfully,

Krystle Acquah
