# dotfiles
This repository contains my configuration files. I use the following programs:
+ *(neo)vim* for text editing.
+ *zathura* to view pdf files.
+ *offlineimap* + *mutt* + *msmtp* to receive, wirte, and send emails.
+ *zsh* with the *oh-my-zsh* framework as my shell. 

All the configuration files can be installed by executing the script install.sh.
