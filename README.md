# dotfiles
This repository contains my configuration files. I use the following programs:
+ *vim* for text editing.
+ *zathura* to preview pdf files.
+ *offlineimap* + *mutt* + *msmtp* to receive, wirte, and send emails.
+ *zsh* with the *oh-my-zsh* framework as my shell. 

All the configurations can be installed by executing the script install.sh. If used with arguments, only the files passed to the script will be installed. For example, executing
`./install.sh vim vimrc`
will install my vim configuration.
