# dotfiles
This repository contains my configuration files. I use the following programs:
+ *(neo)vim* for text editing.
+ *zathura* to view pdf files.
+ *offlineimap* + *mutt* + *msmtp* to receive, wirte, and send emails.
+ *zsh* with the *oh-my-zsh* framework as my shell. 

All the configuration files can be installed by executing the script install.sh, which can be used to 

- Install, update, and clean git repositories. Thanks to a parallel implementation inspired from [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), this is done efficiently by the script.
- Install copies (symbolic links) of the configuration files in my home directory.
